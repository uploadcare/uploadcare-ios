# Uploadcare for iOS

This open-source Objective-C library allows you to add [Uploadcare](https://uploadcare.com) to your iOS app.

Uploadcare for iOS comprises [UploadcareKit](https://github.com/uploadcare/uploadcare-ios/tree/master/UploadcareKit), which provides a way to use Uploadcare programmatically, and the Uploadcare widget – a drop-in component that provides the entire user experience.
